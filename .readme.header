# Qute

The cutest queue you'll ever meet.

To use Qute, write jobs that implement `Job`, then run `Start(c, n)` where `c` is a Job channel and `n` is your pool size. For example:

```go
c := make(chan Job)

done := Start(c, 10)

// Send job
c <- myJob

// You'll get the same job back when it's done
myJobCameBack := <-c

// Close to initiate graceful shutdown
close(c)
// Wait for queue to stop
<-done
```
